            Hi! I am Oleksii, a Kyiv based front-end developer looking for
            exciting opportunities.
          </h4>

          <p className="about__info-description">
            All my life I have been fascinated by computer technologies, and now
            I have the lucky chance to gain experience in web development. My
            financial education and experience in the banking sector and retail
            have given me resilience, a responsible attitude to quality and
            confidence in professionalism. My goal is to create products that
            combine functionality and usefulness with aesthetic appeal. I derive
            great satisfaction when achieving exciting results that I can be
            proud of. I am always on the lookout for new technologies and
            innovations in the world of web development, so I never stop
            learning and growing. Outside of work, I enjoy traveling, learning
            foreign languages, being passionate about aviation and cycling, as
            well as deeply loving pets and enjoying walks in nature.
